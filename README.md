## Overview

WebЯcade consists of a simple [web-based front end](https://docs.webrcade.com/userguide/) that provides the ability to play popular gaming content entirely within the context of the browser across a wide variety of platforms.

The content for playing games (binaries, etc.) and populating the front-end (images, etc.) is collected from [cloud-based resources](https://docs.webrcade.com/feeds/resources/) based on [user-defined feeds](https://docs.webrcade.com/feeds/) that are registered via the webЯcade front-end.
